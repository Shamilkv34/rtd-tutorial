To trigger builds from pull requests:

    Click the Settings link on the left under the ⚙ Admin menu, check the “Build pull requests for this project” checkbox, and click the Save button at the bottom of the page.

    Make some changes to your documentation:

After opening the pull request, a Read the Docs check will appear indicating that it is building the documentation for that pull request. If you click the Details link while your project is building the build log will be opened. After building this link opens the documentation directly.
Adding a configuration file

The Admin tab of the project home has some global configuration settings for your project.

Build process configuration settings are in .readthedocs.yaml configuration file, in your Git repository, which means it can be different for every version or branch of your project (more on versioning).
Using different Python versions

To build your project with Python 3.8 instead of the latest Python version, edit the .readthedocs.yaml file and change the Python version to 3.8 like this:
.readthedocs.yaml

version: 2

build:
  os: "ubuntu-22.04"
  tools:
    python: "3.8"

python:
  install:
    - requirements: docs/requirements.txt

sphinx:
  configuration: docs/source/conf.py

The purpose of each key in the .readthedocs.yaml configuration file is:

version

    Required, specifies version 2 of the configuration file.
build.os

    Required, specifies the Docker image used to build the documentation. states the name of the base image.
build.tools.python

    Specifies the Python version.
python.install.requirements

    Specifies what Python dependencies to install.

After you commit these changes, go back to your project home, navigate to the “Builds” page, and open the new build that just started. You will notice that one of the lines contains python -mvirtualenv: if you click on it, you will see the full output of the corresponding command, stating that it used Python 3.8.6, the latest version of Python 3.8, to create the virtual environment.

Making build warnings more visible

If you navigate to your HTML documentation, you will notice that the index page looks correct but the API section is empty. This is a very common issue with Sphinx, and the reason is stated in the build logs. On the build page you opened before, click on the View raw link on the top right, which opens the build logs in plain text, and you will see several warnings:

WARNING: [autosummary] failed to import 'lumache': no module named lumache
...
WARNING: autodoc: failed to import function 'get_random_ingredients' from module 'lumache'; the following exception was raised:
No module named 'lumache'
WARNING: autodoc: failed to import exception 'InvalidKindError' from module 'lumache'; the following exception was raised:
No module named 'lumache'

To spot these warnings more easily and help you to address them, add the sphinx.fail_on_warning option to your Read the Docs configuration file.

To fail on warnings to your Read the Docs project, edit the .readthedocs.yaml file in your project, add the three lines of sphinx configuration below, and commit the file:
.readthedocs.yaml

version: 2

build:
  os: "ubuntu-22.04"
  tools:
    python: "3.8"

python:
  install:
    - requirements: docs/requirements.txt

sphinx:
  configuration: docs/source/conf.py
  fail_on_warning: true

If you navigate to your “Builds” page, you will see a Failed build, which is expected because we’ve configured Sphinx to fail on warnings and several warnings were encountered during the build.

To learn how to fix these warnings, see the next section.
Installing Python dependencies

The reason sphinx.ext.autosummary and sphinx.ext.autodoc fail to import the Making build warnings more visible, is because the lumache module is not installed.

You will need to specify those installation requirements in .readthedocs.yaml.

To install your project dependencies and make your code available to Sphinx, edit .readthedocs.yaml, add the python.install section and commit it:
.readthedocs.yaml

python:
  install:
    - requirements: docs/requirements.txt
    # Install our python package before building the docs
    - method: pip
      path: .

Now, Read the Docs installs the Python code before starting the Sphinx build, which will finish seamlessly. If you go now to the API page of your HTML documentation, you will see the lumache summary! :tada:
Enabling PDF and EPUB builds

Sphinx can build several other formats in addition to HTML, such as PDF and EPUB. You might want to enable these formats for your project so your users can read the documentation offline.

To do so, add the following formats to your .readthedocs.yaml:
.readthedocs.yaml

sphinx:
  configuration: docs/source/conf.py
  fail_on_warning: true

formats:
  - pdf
  - epub

After this change, PDF and EPUB downloads will be available both from the “Downloads” section of the project home, as well as the flyout menu.
Downloads available from the flyout menu

Downloads available from the flyout menu
Versioning documentation

Read the Docs supports having several versions of your documentation, in the same way that you have several versions of your code. By default, it creates a latest version that points to the default branch of your version control system (main in the case of this tutorial), and that’s why the URLs of your HTML documentation contain the string /latest/.
Creating a new version of your documentation

Read the Docs automatically creates documentation versions from GitHub branches and tags that follows some rules about looking like version numbers, such as 1.0, 2.0.3 or 4.x.

To create version 1.0 of your code, and consequently of your documentation:

    Navigate to your GitHub repository, click the branch selector, type 1.0.x, and click “Create branch: 1.0.x from ‘main’” (more information in the GitHub documentation).

    Check that you now have version 1.0.x in your project home, click on the Versions button, and under “Active Versions” you will see two entries:

        The latest version, pointing to the main branch.

        A new stable version, pointing to the origin/1.0.x branch.

List of active versions of the project

List of active versions of the project

When you created your branch, Read the Docs created a new special version called stable pointing to it. When it’s built it will be listed in the flyout menu.
Setting stable as the default

To set stable as the default version, rather than latest, so that users see the stable documentation when they visit the root URL of your documentation:

    In the the ⚙ Admin menu of your project home, go to the Settings link, choose stable in the “Default version*” dropdown, and hit Save at the bottom.

Modifying versions

Both latest and stable are now active, which means that they are visible for users, and new builds can be triggered for them. In addition to these, Read the Docs also created an inactive 1.0.x version, which will always point to the 1.0.x branch of your repository.
List of inactive versions of the project

List of inactive versions of the project

To activate the 1.0.x version:

    On your project home, go to the “Versions”, locate 1.0.x under “Activate a version”, and click the Activate button.

    On the “Activate” page with “Active” and “Hidden” checkboxes, check only “Active” and click Save.

Note

Read more about hidden versions in our documentation.
Getting project insights

Once your project is up and running, you will probably want to understand how readers are using your documentation, addressing some common questions like:

    what are the most visited pages?

    what are the most frequently used search terms?

    are readers finding what they are looking for?

Read the Docs has traffic and search analytics tools to help you find answers to these questions.
Understanding traffic analytics

The Traffic Analytics view gives you a simple overview of how your readers browse your documentation. It respects visitor privacy by not storing identifying information about your them.

This page shows the most viewed documentation pages of the past 30 days, plus a visualization of the daily views during that period.

To see the Traffic Analytics view, go back the project page again, click the ⚙ Admin button, and then click the Traffic Analytics section. You will see the list of pages in descending order of visits, and a similar visualization to this one:
Traffic Analytics plot

Traffic Analytics plot

You can also download this data in CSV format for closer inspection. To do that, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Download all data button.
Understanding search analytics

As well as traffic analytics, Read the Docs shows what terms your readers are searching for. This can inform decisions on what areas to focus on, or what parts of your project are less understood or more difficult to find.

To generate some artificial search statistics on the project, go to the HTML documentation, locate the Sphinx search box on the left, type ingredients, and press the Enter key. You will be redirected to the search results page, which will show two entries.

Next, go back to the ⚙ Admin section of your project page, and then click the Search Analytics section. You will see a table with the most searched queries (including the ingredients one you just typed), how many results did each query return, and how many times it was searched. Below the queries table, you will also see a visualization of the daily number of search queries during the past 30 days.
Most searched terms
